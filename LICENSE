Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be that person.

Being that person includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a #$!?.
1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER #$!?.

If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work, share the love. Only that person would make loads off this work and not treat the original works creator(s).

Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes you a non-human #$!?. Fix the problem yourself. A non-human would submit the fix back.  That includes corporations.
